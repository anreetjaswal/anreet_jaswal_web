    <p>Chaotic is a T.V. show that I have been watching since I was a kid. This show strated in 2006 and it ended it 2010, I was about cry, but then I later figured that I could just watch the episodes again on YouTube. So Chaotic is a show that has three seasons and each season has a different number of episodes. Like the first season had forty episodes, the second seasoon has twenty-seven episodes, and lastly the thrid season has thirteen episodes. This show never dissapointed me, because the show was just so good and interesting that it caught the viewers attention. This show is about normal kids like us that play this card game and they have these cell phone devices called scanners. A boy named Tom Majors soon discovers that his scanner is just not a scanner it was actually a portal that could transport him to his onine game. You see first you are at home and you want to go to chaotic, which is the place where the place your scanner traspoets you to. That's where you battle other kids, but not with cards you actually become the creature. Plus if you didn't know that the creatures are actually alive in the show, they live in this world called Perem, and the cool thing is that the kids can also transport to Perem using there scanners. One cool thing about Perem that there are four tribes which are, the overworlders, the underworlders, the danianas, and last the mipedians. The four tribes hate each other. Beleive it or not but I am sixteen years old and I still watch this, I finish the three seasons in about two to three months and then I take a break from chaotic for a month and watch some other new shows. I would rate this T.V. series a full ten out of 10, I reaaly want everyone to wacth it, because it is just amazing. It just sparks the inner kid in you.

    <p>Tom Majors is the one of the main characters in this show. He is an overworlder fan and a close frined with Maxxor. Tom has helped the creatures save Perem multiple times for villians or natural disasters. Many of the overworlders in Perem trust him t the fullest, and he also helps around the overworld area alot too.</p>
    <hr>
    <p> Kas Kalinkas is also a main character in this show. Kas is a underworlder fan. He is close frineds with Chaor, but Chaor just uses him so he can find out all of Maxxor's secrets because Kas is friends with Tom. Overall Kas is a good kid, he just doesn't know that Chaor is using him.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Peyton Touhey is also another main character and he is a Mepedian fan. Mepidians are basically knw as lizards or snakes. They live in the dessert. Peyton is a really nice guy and he is a really good Chaotic player. Many people judge him because of his size but when he battles them, he shuts the others persons mouth up completely. He is one of my favourite characters.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Sarah Laurence is the only girl main character in this show. She is a Danian fan, who are mostly ants. Sarah is a very nice girl and a very good Chaotic player. Sarah also does have a little crush on Tom Majors but never even gives anyone a hint during the whole show.</p>

            Chaotic looks really nice, I mean it is so high-tech. Rather than having humans as waiters, they have robots. As you can see in the first picture there are massive tvs. There are really comfy sofas, I mean it is luxury. In the second photo it shows a visual of how outside of chaotic looks like, the the buildings on the sides are actually the places where the kids battle.

            There are many locations in Perem but as you can see the image in the middle, that is a location called "Kiru City". And as you can see the images left and right to the location, those are what the creature look like. They each have power and attacks, like fire attacks, water attacks, earth attacks, and many more.

        <p>Maxxor is the ruler of the over world, he is the second ruler of the overworld. Maxxor's father was the first ever ruler of the overworld. Maxxor is probably the wisest, noble, humble, nicest, and smartest out of all the creatures in Perem. He is a master at fire and earth attacks, but also is good at water and wind attacks but not as good as his fire and earth attacks.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Intress is a female overworld creature, she is basically a tiger and she looks tougher than she actually looks. She has helped Maxxor in many battles. She is basically the the one who is in charge when Maxxor is not there. She is a master of water and earth attacks.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Tangath is also an overworlder and he is very close with Maxxor, just think that tangath is the second ruler of the overworld. He is basically a lion and is a manster at fire, earth, air, and water, so he a master at all attacks.</p>

        <p>
            I dislike chaor very much because, he is actually a little bt of a villan and he always brings Maxxor down. Chaor just thinks that he is the best, when truly he is not. Chaor is actually the ruler of the underworld and ratehr than teaching his people good things to do, he does the complete opposite. He tells his people to steal from others and always put down weak people, and he says fighting is always the solution when it is not.
