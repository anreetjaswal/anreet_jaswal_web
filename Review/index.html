    <p>Chaotic is a T.V. show that I have been watching since I was a kid. This show strated in 2006 and it ended it 2010, I was about cry, but then I later figured that I could just watch the episodes again on YouTube. So Chaotic is a show that has three seasons and each season has a different number of episodes. Like the first season had forty episodes, the second seasoon has twenty-seven episodes, and lastly the thrid season has thirteen episodes. This show never dissapointed me, because the show was just so good and interesting that it caught the viewers attention. This show is about normal kids like us that play this card game and they have these cell phone devices called scanners. A boy named Tom Majors soon discovers that his scanner is just not a scanner it was actually a portal that could transport him to his onine game. You see first you are at home and you want to go to chaotic, which is the place where the place your scanner traspoets you to. That's where you battle other kids, but not with cards you actually become the creature. Plus if you didn't know that the creatures are actually alive in the show, they live in this world called Perem, and the cool thing is that the kids can also transport to Perem using there scanners. One cool thing about Perem that there are four tribes which are, the overworlders, the underworlders, the danianas, and last the mipedians. The four tribes hate each other. Beleive it or not but I am sixteen years old and I still watch this, I finish the three seasons in about two to three months and then I take a break from chaotic for a month and watch some other new shows. I would rate this T.V. series a full ten out of 10, I reaaly want everyone to wacth it, because it is just amazing. It just sparks the inner kid in you.

            Chaotic looks really nice, I mean it is so high-tech. Rather than having humans as waiters, they have robots. As you can see in the first picture there are massive tvs. There are really comfy sofas, I mean it is luxury. In the second photo it shows a visual of how outside of chaotic looks like, the the buildings on the sides are actually the places where the kids battle.

            There are many locations in Perem but as you can see the image in the middle, that is a location called "Kiru City". And as you can see the images left and right to the location, those are what the creature look like. They each have power and attacks, like fire attacks, water attacks, earth attacks, and many more.

        <p>
            I dislike chaor very much because, he is actually a little bt of a villan and he always brings Maxxor down. Chaor just thinks that he is the best, when truly he is not. Chaor is actually the ruler of the underworld and ratehr than teaching his people good things to do, he does the complete opposite. He tells his people to steal from others and always put down weak people, and he says fighting is always the soluton when it is not.
