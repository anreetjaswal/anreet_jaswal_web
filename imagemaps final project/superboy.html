    <h2>About Superboy</h2>
    <p>Superboy is pretty much the strongest hero in the squad, but his anger does not make him the wisest. Superboy is not actually born like normal humans, he is actually not even fully human. Superboy is half human and half alein. He was made to desroy Superman and the whole Justice Legue, but it was a miracle that he turned out to be a good guy and join the Young Justice Legue. Sadly he is the son of Lex Luthor, Superman's biggest enemy but no one know this except Superboy's girlfriend, Missmartian. The Justice Legue does not trust Superboy that much because he was made to destroy them all, espically Batman. Batman is the one who started this conversation about not trusting Superboy, but Superman came in and said, he is like my brother. Later on Superboy risked his own life to save every single member of the Justice Legue, from that day on every member had full trust and faith in him, including Batman. </p>
