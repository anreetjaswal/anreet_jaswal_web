    <h2>About Artemis</h2>
    <p>Artemis has came through a very rough past, her whole family is evil except her. She struggles to tell the Legue where she is from, but one day she gets the courage to tell them. She was surprised the Legue did not get upset, infact they said they trust her. From that day on she puts in a lot of hard work in her missions and does whatever she can to win. Artemis does not have any special powers, but her talent is bow arrow, just like her mentor Green Arrow. Artemis is dating another member of the squad and his name is Kidflash. They never broke up, but sadly life broke them apart, because in the very last episode Kidflash actually dies. This was alot to take in for Artemis so in the very last episode she retires from the Legue.</p>
