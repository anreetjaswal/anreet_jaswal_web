    <h2>About Robin</h2>
    <p>Robin is the most wisest and smartest out of all the members in the squad, he is the nerd of the group. Robin has a very sad past, he lost his parents at a very young age. Him and Batman make a good team and they both have a lot in common. You see Batman also lost his parents as a kid and Batman and Robin are both great detectives. Robin does not have any powers he uses is own knowledge, skills and strength to beat his openent, I guess you can call him a tech guy too. Robin is the one to look for if you need to hack into anything. Later on in the show Robin becomes Nightwing and his sidekick is then called Robin. He was also the leader of the squad for short period of time, when Aqualad was gone on an undercover mission.</p>
