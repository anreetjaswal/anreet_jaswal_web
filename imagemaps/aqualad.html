    <h2>About Aqualad</h2>
    <p>Aqualad is the sidekick if Aquaman Aqualad is very respectful and loyal to everyone, he is also the leader of the Young Justice. Sadly Aqualads father is evil and also very dangerous, but the whole Legue still trusts Aqualad and he is thankful for that. Aqualad has never failed any of his missions no matter how hard they were. Later in the show Aqualad had a mission and it was to pretend that he turned into a bad guy and joined his father, but the mission was to fix the damage his father did and then kill his father. That mission took a full year to do. Unlike the others Aqualad has no girlfriend and in the show he mentions that he does not beleive in love.</p>
