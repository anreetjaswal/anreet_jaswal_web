    <h2>About Missmartian</h2>
    <p>Missmartian is not the most strongest memeber but she is the most powerful member, she has so many special powers. She has the ability to read peoples minds which is good for battles so she can know what the opponent is about to do. She also has the power to be invisble and also control the others mind. But later on the enemys made this head gear that could not let Missmartian read anyones mind. She is the neice of Martian Manhunter and the girlfriend of Superboy, but their relations ended because Missmartian would take advantage of her mind reading powers and use it on Superboy, which he did not like. Missmartian is an alein from another planet, but she acts like a total girly girl. Her skin color is greenm but she has shape shifting powers so she can turn in to basically anything including becoming a human. She is also a very caring person for her loved ones, but during mission she puts purpose before feelings.</p>
